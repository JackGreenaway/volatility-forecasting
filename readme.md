# Volatility Prediction with Machine Learning (Work in Progress)
This is a work in progress directory that aims to build a machine learning model for predicting volatility in financial markets. The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm that can accurately forecast changes in market volatility, which can be used as a tool for making informed investment decisions.

## Project Overview
The project will involve the following steps:

- Data Collection: Collecting historical financial data, such as stock prices, market indices, and other relevant indicators.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the collected data, including handling missing values, normalizing data, and splitting it into training and testing sets.
- Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from the data, such as technical indicators, sentiment analysis, and macroeconomic factors, to be used as inputs for the machine learning model.
- Model Selection: Evaluating and selecting appropriate machine learning algorithms, such as regression, time series analysis, or deep learning, based on their performance and suitability for the task of volatility prediction.
- Model Training: Training the selected machine learning model using the preprocessed data and fine-tuning hyperparameters to achieve the best performance.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the trained model using appropriate performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to assess its predictive accuracy and generalization ability.
- Model Deployment: Deploying the trained model in a real-world environment to make real-time predictions and monitor its performance.
- Model Refinement: Continuously refining the model based on feedback and improving its accuracy and reliability.

## Current Status
Currently, the project is in the early stages of data collection and preprocessing. Historical financial data from various sources is being collected and cleaned, and feature engineering techniques are being explored to extract relevant features for volatility prediction. Machine learning algorithms are being evaluated and compared to select the most suitable one for the task.
